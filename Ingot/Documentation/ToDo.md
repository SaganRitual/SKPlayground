#  ToDo List

- Get actions working again
- Sprite to show the edge loop, turn off physics
- Get ShapeLab working again
    - proper workflows for paths, regions, edges
    - proper management of the "database" of paths, regions, edges
- Attach fields to Gremlins
- Delete entities
- Add "set all" and "clear all" to the mask dropdowns
- Buttons in the command pane
    - "select all" with a dropdown next to it with a list of categories of entities
    that can be selected en masse, eg, all gremlins, or all fields, or all drag fields, or all cyclops gremlins, that
    sort of thing.
    - "deselect all" in the same spirit
    - "select next" in the same spirit, allowing the user to repeatedly click to cycle through the specified
    set of entities  
    - "show physics on" in the same spirit, allowing the user to show field lines and physics bodies
- Save and reload across app lifetime
- Scripting?
- Displays on individual entities
    - velocity and other physics properties
    - some kind of visual representation of fields that shows size, strength, and maybe suggests the nature of
    the field. Like SpriteKit's display when "showsPhysics" is on, but better. SpriteKit's field display is weird, and
    "showsPhysics" isn't always honored
- Zoom using mouse wheel
- Button in command pane to recover gremlins that have escaped the visible area
- Bugs
    - That one where a gremlin jumps back and forth between two positions occasionally
